# DIVINE || DARSHAN

DIVINE || DARSHAN is a cinematic, static web experience designed as a digital mandir. The project focuses on atmosphere, motion, silence, and visual restraint to evoke a sense of spiritual presence rather than traditional website interaction.

---

## Concept

The project explores how modern web technologies can be used to represent spirituality without excess. Instead of dense information or heavy 3D models, the experience relies on:

* Slow, intentional motion
* Minimal text
* High-contrast imagery
* Ambient sound and visual noise
* Spatial rhythm and silence

---

## Featured Deities

The website presents a curated sequence of Hindu deities, each treated as a full-screen visual chapter:

* **Ganesha** — The beginning and removal of obstacles
* **Brahma** — The source of creation
* **Vishnu** — The preserver of cosmic order
* **Shiva** — Stillness, destruction, and renewal
* **Durga** — Strength and protective compassion
* **Hanuman** — Devotion and surrender

Each deity section combines a cinematic image, a short Sanskrit verse, and a restrained English descriptor.

## Technical Overview

The project is intentionally built as a static website to maintain simplicity, performance, and ease of deployment.

### Technologies Used

* HTML5 for structure
* CSS3 for layout, theming, masking, and visual effects
* Vanilla JavaScript for interaction and animation logic
* GSAP and ScrollTrigger for cinematic scroll-based animations
* Lenis for smooth scrolling
* Canvas for fluid background motion

No frameworks, build tools, or backend services are used.
